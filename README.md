# Mini Bank â€“ Management Microservices

Project developed to showcase my programming skills and enhance my professional portfolio. The system is based on a microservices architecture and implements banking management functionalities using Java and Spring Boot. It features asynchronous communication via RabbitMQ, service-to-service integration with Feign Client, and data persistence with Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Technologies such as Lombok, Bean Validation, and best architecture practices were applied to ensure code organization, readability, and scalability.
